# Conf

This repository is my **personal config store** where I keep everything I generally use, so I can maintain versions and easily manage my setup.

I also keep a lot of **automation scripts, tools, and config files** here that I use on my laptop.

Feel free to use anything here according to your needs. Everything is **free to use**, and you can **customize it** as you like.

If you want, you can **star this repo** ❤️ - I regularly update it with my settings, configs, scripts, and automation tools.
This helps me in daily life, and I hope it will help you too!
